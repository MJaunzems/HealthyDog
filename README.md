# HealthyDog

Web Application for proper dogs nutrition.

ðŸ¦´ Problem: not all dog owners have the opportunity to give their pet how much food according to breed standards and their age, and sometimes there is also no way to check what can be given to their pet

ðŸ¦´Goal: Create an Web application that will calculate the optimal amount of food and show, upon request, whether a dog can be given a certain food or not.

ðŸ¦´Assignment: In the web application it should be possible to enter the weight, age and breed of the dog to calculate optimal nutrition, and upon request, feed options are provided according to the price range for the user, 
also add an option to enter the food you want to give to the dog - the application will answer whether it is possible or not.  
Need to create a database with different types of food, according to their calorie content and price, and add prohibited and permitted types of food for dogs
